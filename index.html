      <p>
        The Environment Protection and Awareness Club of BIT Mesra, popularly
        known as EPAC is a club whose sole motive to instigate the students of
        our campus to proactively contemplate about the detrimental effects on
        our environment in the current scenario. It has been observed that rapid
        urbanization, and industrialization has led to a serious global
        environment crisis. We, as a student body aim at, improvising the
        exisiting systems which lay in the favour of nature. We have started a
        plethora of initiatives in our lush green Institute campus to aid the
        upliftment of the environment and make the students aware of the
        repercussions of an unhealthy environment. With an objective to nurture
        nature in return to what all it has done for us, we selflessly carry out
        activities with paramount dedication and unequivocal semblance of ideas
        to save what has been ours for so many years. We work in consonance with
        the latest advancements in technology to bring about small differences
        which might lead towards a huge change.

                April 22nd, 1970 was a prominent day for the United States of
                America, as it went down in history as the inception of Earth
                Day, the nation-wide initiative for protecting the environment.
                Decades passed by, and the Earth Day was upscaled as a
                world-wide initiative, and thus including more than 192
                countries of the world. <br />
                The 51st commemoration of Earth Day is themed on "Restore Our
                Earth" and its focus is on natural processes, emerging green
                technologies and innovative thinking that can restore the
                world’s ecosystems. It also features five primary programmes:
                The Canopy Project, Food and Environment, Climate Literacy, the
                Global Earth Challenge, and The Great Global CleanUp.

                The combined effects caused by amazon forest fires are
                irreversible and imposes great threat to us and future
                generations as well. The explication of what we're losing in
                these fires is perhaps ineffable for we are losing the so called
                'LUNGS' of the Earth.
